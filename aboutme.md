## My name is Panagiotis Kontogiannis. 
I'm a self-taught web developer with expertise in building scalable, performant websites using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Design complex WordPress solutions for back-end and front-end development to establish and guide website architecture and functionality. Collaborate with clients to develop site-map guidelines and requirements to capture content, features and functionality for site development efforts. Develop custom mobile-friendly WordPress templates and themes to align with site design and branding for clients. The primary focus of a WordPress developer is to work with clients to conceptualize, design, build, test and implement custom website solutions from its functionality to appearance for both the front and back-end views of the website using WordPress.
